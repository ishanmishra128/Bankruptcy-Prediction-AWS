    "\n",
    "The dataset has **24** columns and the column named **bankrupt** is used as\n",

    "**maximizes** the \"**F1**\" quality metric of the trained models.\n",
    "The \"**F1**\" metric applies for binary classification with a positive and negative class. It mixes between precision and recall, and is recommended in cases where there are more negative examples compared to positive examples.\n",

    "As part of the AutoML job, the input dataset has been randomly split into two pieces, one for **training** and one for\n",
    "**validation**. Given an input dataset, Amazon SageMaker Autopilot runs one trial with hyperparameter settings.\n",
    "This notebook helps you inspect and modify the hyperparameter proposed by Amazon SageMaker Autopilot.\n",
