# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Data Pipeline for Bankruptcy Prediction | AWS (S3, Glue, Redshift, SageMaker)

## üìò Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Gen Bus 780 Final Project at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison**. I was honored to take this graduate level class with Katie Gaertner.
It focuses on designing and implementing an **end-to-end cloud-native data architecture on AWS** to help a financial firm (MSBA Financial Group) centralize its scattered datasets, automate ETL workflows, and apply machine learning for **bankruptcy prediction**.

The system integrates **three key data sources** ‚Äî financial statements, accounting ratios, and bankruptcy records ‚Äî into a single source of truth using **AWS S3, Glue, Redshift, and SageMaker**.  
This pipeline demonstrates the power of cloud automation and predictive analytics in enabling faster, data-driven investment decisions.

## üß† Problem Statement
MSBA Financial Group maintained decentralized datasets:
- **DataCorp Financials:** company balance sheets and income statements  
- **Analyst A Ratios:** accounting ratios derived from financial data  
- **Analyst B Bankruptcies:** historical bankruptcy filings  

This architecture lacked:
- A unified repository for analytics  
- Automated data ingestion and transformation  
- Predictive modeling capabilities  

The goal was to build a **scalable AWS-based data pipeline** to automate ingestion, transformation, storage, and predictive modeling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Lake (AWS S3)
- Created structured S3 buckets for **raw**, **cleaned**, and **training** datasets.  
- Defined clear folder hierarchies for ingestion and transformation stages.  
- Enabled cost-efficient storage and access management with versioning and lifecycle policies.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ETL & Transformation (AWS Glue)
- Designed and executed **ETL workflows** using AWS Glue to:
  - Parse and clean raw CSV and TXT files.
  - Merge datasets from multiple analysts into a unified schema.
  - Handle missing and inconsistent values.  
- Automated pipeline reduced manual processing time by **80%**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Warehousing (AWS Redshift)
- Created a **Redshift cluster** to host transformed data.  
- Defined analytical schemas combining financial, ratio, and bankruptcy data.  
- Enabled seamless SQL querying for downstream analysis.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning (AWS SageMaker)
- Imported cleaned data from Redshift for model training.  
- Trained a **supervised learning model** to predict the probability of corporate bankruptcy.  
- Achieved **97% accuracy** on validation data.  
- Deployed model endpoints for batch prediction on new companies.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Findings:
- **Liquidity (Working Capital / Total Assets)** and **Profitability (Net Income / Total Assets)** emerged as the strongest bankruptcy indicators.
![EDA Plot 1](eda_plot1.png)
- **Low liquidity + low profitability** corresponded strongly with high bankruptcy risk.  
- Firms with **high debt loads** were more prone to bankruptcy, though not the sole determinant.
![EDA Plot 1](eda_plot2.png)
- Non-bankrupt firms showed higher variability in financial ratios, while bankrupt firms clustered in tighter ranges.
